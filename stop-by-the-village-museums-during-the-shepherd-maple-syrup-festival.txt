# Stop by the Village museums during the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival

There are three museums which will be open to the public during the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival on April 21 - 23. They are the Train Depot, the Little Red Schoolhouse, and the Powerhouse Museum. Each offer an intriguing glance at Shepherd’s past.

#Train Depot
The Train Depot Museum, which is open on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday during the festival, includes an actual caboose and a train engine which visitors can climb aboard. The train station is a museum filled with items which were used in the past.

When our oldest two kids were younger, we would always make a point of stopping at the Train Depot Museum when it was open. It is a great opportunity to learn about history, and its hard to resist the chance to get picture on board either the caboose or the train engine.

##Little Red Schoolhouse
When I’m inside the Little Red Schoolhouse located in front of the Shepherd Middle School, I can’t help but feel like I’ve actually traveled backwards to a simpler time. For me, the interior of the schoolhouse reminds me of the set from the show “Little House on the Prairie,” but I also know that the one room school house is not that old of a concept. I’ve learned that my mom attended a smaller, single room school in the country before she was moved to the larger Howell Public School district.

Inside the museum, visitors can take a look at a wide range of items from Shepherd’s past, including a stack of class photos. There are also photo opportunities inside the schoolhouse, whether you want to stand in front of the class, have a seat behind one of the desks, or sit in the corner. The Little Red Schoolhouse will be open on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
